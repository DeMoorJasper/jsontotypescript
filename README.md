# Simple JSON to TypeScript class convertor
Usage

Install dependancies
```
npm i
```

Build & Run - only for development usage
```
npm start
```

Build - to build to source to be able to use "npm run run"
```
npm run build
```

Just run - way faster in production usage (execute npm start or npm run build first)
```
npm run run
```
